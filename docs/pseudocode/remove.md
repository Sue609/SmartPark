# Remove function pseudocode - Deletes a Car from the parking lot

This function removes a car (identified by its number plate) from the parking lot (hash table).
If first computes the index using the hash function, then linearly probes forward until it finds the matching plate.

```
DEFINE remove(number_plate, parking_lot):
    # Step 1: Compute the initial parking index
    index = hash(number_plate, parking_lot)
    start = index

    # Step 2: Search for the car using linear probing
    WHILE parking_lot[index] is NOT empty:
        IF parking_lot[index] == number_plate:
            parking_lot[index] is "DELETED"
            PRINT "car removed successfully:", number_plate
            RETURN

        # Move to the next slot
        index = (index + 1) MOD length of number_plate

        # If we have looped back to the start, stop searching
        IF index == start:
            PRINT "Car not found:", number_plate
            RETURN

    # Step 3: Car not found
    PRINT "Car not found:", number_plate
